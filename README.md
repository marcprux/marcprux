#### Ancient History

* :black_nib: I penned a tweet only once, back in 2008. [Follow me](https://twitter.com/marcprux) and I pledge that I will compose another one once I hit 250 followers.
* :open_book: Also in 2008, I wrote [Stanza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexcycle), the first iPhone ebook reader on the App Store.
