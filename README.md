#### Profiteering: <!-- Oh man, I am wicked broke! -->

#### Hobbies:

* :musical_keyboard: **Music**: I am a beginner melodica player. Never had one lesson! <!-- This shows that I can make clever movie references. -->
* :running: **Running**: I enjoy running, both in my home city of Boston as well as when travelling. I have logged around 8,000 miles (~13,000 km) in RunKeeper since 2008, including six half-marathons and five marathons (most recently Paris 2022) <!-- This signals that I am healthy. -->
* :small_airplane: **Aviation**: I am a singe-engine fixed-wing airplane pilot with an FAA commercial certificate and instrument rating, complex & high-performance (300 PIC hours in: Cessna 172, Piper Warrior, Archer, Arrow, Diamond DA-40, Cirrus SR-20 and SR-22) <!-- Trustworthiness and attention to detail! -->

#### Older stuff:

* :writing_hand: I have only ever posted but a single tweet, back in 2008. [Follow me](https://twitter.com/marcprux) and I pledge that I will compose another one once I hit 26k followers. <!-- Last time I checked, I had 46 followers. -->
* :open_book: Also back in 2008, I developed [Stanza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexcycle), the first iPhone ebook reader on the App Store. <!-- I'll tell that story someday. -->
