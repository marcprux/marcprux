## :vulcan_salute: Hi there

#### Here is what I'm working on right now:

* [:gift: The App Fair](https://appfair.net): A free and fair distribution network for native Mac and iPhone apps (please [follow :bird:](https://twitter.com/theappfair) and [star :star:](https://github.com/appfair/App/stargazers) the platform).
* [:tickets: App Fair.app](https://appfair.app): A catalog application for the App Fair written in SwiftUI (please [download :elevator:](https://github.com/App-Fair/App/releases/latest/download/App-Fair-macOS.zip) and [star :star:](https://github.com/App-Fair/App/stargazers) the app).
* [:gift_heart: Open source](https://github.com/marcprux): I contribute to numerous open source projects, including the [Fair](https://github.com/fair-ground/Fair/) package (please [star :star:](https://github.com/fair-ground/Fair/stargazers) the framework).
* [:speaking_head: Talks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcprux/): I sometimes give invited talks and tutorials about app development in Swift ([reach out to me :call_me_hand:](mailto:marc@prux.org)).

#### Hobbies:

* :running: **Running**: I enjoy running, both in my home city of Boston as well as when travelling. I have logged around 8,000 miles (~13,000 km) in RunKeeper since 2008, including six half-marathons and five marathons (most recently Paris 2022).
* :small_airplane: **Aviation**: I am developing an aviation weather üå¶Ô∏è app. I am an airplane pilot holding a singe-engine fixed-wing FAA commercial certificate and instrument rating with over 300 pilot-in-command hours (Cessna 172, Piper Warrior, Archer, and Arrow, Diamond DA-40, Cirrus SR-20 and SR-22).

#### Older stuff:

* :black_nib: I have only ever posted but a single tweet, back in 2008. [Follow me](https://twitter.com/marcprux) and I pledge that I will compose another one once I hit 250 followers.
* :open_book: Also back in 2008, I developed [Stanza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexcycle), the first iPhone ebook reader on the App Store.
